# EmailClientHelper-Swift
A simple helper package to send an email using 3rd party email clients. Supported clients include Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo Mail.

Currently, the package only supports iOS, Mac Catalyst and visionOS.

You will also need to add this in your app's `Info.plist`:

```
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>googlegmail</string>
  <string>ms-outlook</string>
  <string>ymail</string>
</array>
```
